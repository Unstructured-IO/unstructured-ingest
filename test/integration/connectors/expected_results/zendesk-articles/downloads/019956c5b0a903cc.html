 The Help Center is designed to provide a complete self-service support option for your customers. The Help Center contains: a knowledge base and, on Guide Professional and Enterprise, a Customer Portal for support requests. You can also add a community to your Help Center if you have Zendesk Gather.
</p>
<p>
 Your customers can search for knowledge base articles to learn a task or search the community, if available, to ask fellow users questions. If your customers can't find an answer, they can submit a support request.
